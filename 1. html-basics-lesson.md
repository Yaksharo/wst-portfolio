## Part 1: Introduction to HTML (15 minutes)

### What is HTML?
- **HTML** = HyperText Markup Language
- The language used to create web pages
- Uses "tags" to mark up content
- Think of it as giving instructions to the browser

### How HTML Works
- HTML tells the browser what each piece of content is
- Example: "This is a heading", "This is a paragraph", "This is a button"
- Browsers read HTML and display it as a webpage

### HTML Tags Explained
- Tags are enclosed in angle brackets: `<tag>`
- Most tags have opening and closing versions: `<tag>content</tag>`
- Some tags are self-closing: `<br>`

## Part 2: Your First HTML Document (20 minutes)

### Activity 2.1: Creating Your First HTML File

**Step 1: Set Up Your Workspace**
1. Open your text editor (VS Code, Notepad++, etc.)
2. Create a new file
3. Save it as `my-first-page.html`

**Step 2: Basic HTML Structure**
Type this exact code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Step 3: View in Browser**
1. Save your file
2. Double-click the file or right-click ‚Üí "Open with" ‚Üí Browser
3. See your webpage!

### Understanding the Structure
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` - Tells browser this is HTML5
- `<html>` - Contains everything
- `<head>` - Information about the page (not visible)
- `<title>` - Shows in browser tab
- `<body>` - Everything visible on the page
- `<h1>` - Main heading
- `<p>` - Paragraph of text

### Quick Practice
Have students change:
1. The title to their name
2. The heading to "Welcome to [Your Name]'s Page"
3. The paragraph to introduce themselves

## Part 3: Text Elements (20 minutes)

### Headings
HTML has 6 levels of headings:

```html
<h1>Biggest Heading</h1>
<h2>Second Level</h2>
<h3>Third Level</h3>
<h4>Fourth Level</h4>
<h5>Fifth Level</h5>
<h6>Smallest Heading</h6>
```

### Paragraphs
```html
<p>This is a paragraph. It can contain multiple sentences and will wrap automatically when the line gets too long.</p>

<p>This is another paragraph. Each paragraph tag creates a new block of text with space above and below.</p>
```

### Activity 3.1: Practice with Text Elements

Create a new file called `text-practice.html` and build a simple "About Me" page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>About Me</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>About [Your Name]</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Write a paragraph introducing yourself here.</p>
    
    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Describe your hobbies and interests in this paragraph.</p>
    
    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <p>What do you want to learn or achieve? Write about it here.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Student Task:** Fill in the content with their own information.

## Part 4: Links and Basic Interactivity (15 minutes)

### Creating Links
Links connect web pages together:

```html
<a href="https://www.google.com">Visit Google</a>
<a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank">Open GitHub in New Tab</a>
```

- `href` = where the link goes
- `target="_blank"` = opens in new tab

### Buttons
Buttons make pages interactive:

```html
<button>Click Me!</button>
<button>Subscribe</button>
<button>Learn More</button>
```

### Activity 4.1: Adding Links and Buttons

Add these to your "About Me" page:

```html
<h2>My Favorite Websites</h2>
<p>
  Check out <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> 
  for learning new things!
</p>

<h2>Get in Touch</h2>
<button>Send Message</button>
<button>Connect</button>
```

## Part 5: Lists and Organization (10 minutes)

### Unordered Lists (Bullet Points)
```html
<ul>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ul>
```

### Ordered Lists (Numbered)
```html
<ol>
  <li>Step one</li>
  <li>Step two</li>
  <li>Step three</li>
</ol>
```

### Activity 5.1: Practice with Lists

Add a skills or interests section to your page:

```html
<h2>My Skills</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Add your first skill here</li>
  <li>Add your second skill here</li>
  <li>Add your third skill here</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Learning Goals</h2>
<ol>
  <li>First thing you want to learn</li>
  <li>Second thing you want to learn</li>
  <li>Third thing you want to learn</li>
</ol>
```

## Part 6: Mini Project - Simple Profile Page (10 minutes)

### Activity 6.1: Build Your Profile

Create a new file called `simple-profile.html` and combine everything you've learned:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>[Your Name] - Profile</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>[Your Name]</h1>
    
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Write a brief introduction about yourself.</p>
    
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>Tell us about your school or studies.</p>
    
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Interest 1</li>
      <li>Interest 2</li>
      <li>Interest 3</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <button>Email Me</button>
    <button>Connect</button>
    
    <p>
      Visit my <a href="#" target="_blank">favorite website</a>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Student Challenge:** Customize this template with your own content!

## Common Beginner Mistakes and How to Fix Them

```html
<p>This paragraph has no closing tag

```html
<p>This paragraph is properly closed</p>
<p>Each paragraph has its own tags</p>
```

### 2. Mixing Up Angle Brackets
‚ùå **Wrong:**
```html
[p]This is not HTML[/p]
```

‚úÖ **Correct:**
```html
<p>This is proper HTML</p>
```

### 3. Forgetting Quotes in Attributes
‚ùå **Wrong:**
```html
<a href=https://google.com>Link</a>
```

‚úÖ **Correct:**
```html
<a href="https://google.com">Link</a>
```

### 4. File Extension Issues

## Quick Reference Card

### Essential HTML Tags
| Tag | Purpose | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `<h1>` to `<h6>` | Headings | `<h1>Main Title</h1>` |
| `<p>` | Paragraph | `<p>Some text here</p>` |
| `<a>` | Link | `<a href="url">Link text</a>` |
| `<button>` | Button | `<button>Click me</button>` |
| `<ul>` | Unordered list | `<ul><li>Item</li></ul>` |
| `<ol>` | Ordered list | `<ol><li>Item</li></ol>` |
| `<li>` | List item | `<li>List item</li>` |

### Basic HTML Structure
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
